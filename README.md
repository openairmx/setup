# Set up your AIRMX Pro

A device setup page for AIRMX Pro that utilizes the Web Bluetooth API.
This setup allows users to reconnect the device to the internet now that
AIRMX has ceased operations.

Since we cannot modify the hostname of the MQTT server during the setup
process, please note that we need to remap the domain name __i.airmx.cn__
to our local computing server on your router. Feel free to check out the
server code in a dedicated [repository](https://github.com/openairmx/server).
